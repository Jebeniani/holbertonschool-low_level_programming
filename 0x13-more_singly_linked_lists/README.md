0x13. C - More singly linked lists

General
##How to use linked lists:
1- It uses more memory than ArrayList because of the storage used by its items' references, one for the previous item and one for the next item.

2- Elements in a linked list must be read in order from the beginning (or end) as linked lists are inherently sequential access.
